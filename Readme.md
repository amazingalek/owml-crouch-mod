# CrouchMod

Enables crouching in Outer Wilds, independently of jumping.

Hold the crouch button (default: C) to crouch. The crouching button is configurable.

Crouching combines well with jumping - you can jump directly out of crouching.

Compatible with [Quantum Space Buddies](https://github.com/Raicuparta/quantum-space-buddies).
